# Resume Job Matcher

This is a small web app I built to compare a resume with a job description and see how well they match.

You just upload a resume (in PDF format), paste the job description, and it gives a percentage match. The goal was to make something simple and useful, especially for students and job seekers.

## What the App Does

- Lets you upload your resume
- Lets you paste a job description
- Gives you a match score based on keywords and relevance
- Suggests how good the resume is for that job

## Why I Built This

I wanted to create a project where I could apply what I’ve been learning about Python, web development, and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP). It’s meant to be straightforward, practical, and beginner-friendly.

## What I Used

- Python
- Flask (for the web framework)
- NLTK (for keyword and text processing)
- PDFMiner (to extract text from resume PDF)
- HTML/CSS (for the frontend)

## How to Run the App

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/ananyanayak12/Resume_Job_Matcher 
2. Go into the folder: cd resume-job-matcher
3. Install the required Python libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the app: python app.py
5. Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
## Conclusion

This project was a great way for me to apply what I've been learning in Python, web development and text analysis. It’s a beginner-friendly tool that shows how resumes can be quickly compared to job descriptions using basic NLP techniques.

I built this as a learning experience, but I hope it can also be useful for others who are preparing for jobs or just want to check how well their resume matches a particular role.

Feel free to explore, improve, or contribute to it.
